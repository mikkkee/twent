## Installtion
### Requirements

Twent uses [feedparser](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/feedparser) to parse rss feeds and [pyfiglet](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyfiglet/) to display time.

You need to have them installed to run twent.

### Installation and Running
```
git clone https://github.com/mikkkee/twent.git
cd twent
python twent.py 0
```

## Usage
```
usage: twent.py [-h] Flag [Flags ...]
```

`Flag`s can be numbers or `name`s of feeds you specified in config.ini.

Numbers and `name`s cannot be used together.

If numbers are used, the numbers correspond to the order of rss feeds in config.ini, starting from 1.

Use `0` as `Flag` to display all feeds together.

Press `Ctrl-C` to stop twent.
